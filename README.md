# TTGO VINTAGE PC CASE

A vintage collectable mini tower desktop PC for TTGO VGA ESP32 board. Specially for FabGL IBM PC Emulator (http://www.fabglib.org/_v_g_a_2_p_c_emulator_2_p_c_emulator_8ino-example.html).

# Inspiration

This 3D case was created by me inspired on my childroot PC XT AT tower desktop PC :). I've modelled the case to fit the TTGO VGA ESP32 board without soldering or hard modifications. Of course, the PC connectors was not in the right place, I created it to be decorative, but userful!

# Printing

I printed my case using a Ender 3 V1:

  * Material: PLA
  * Size: 0.1mm
  * Filament temperature: 215oC
  * Desk temperature: 60oC
  * Supports: No
  * Speed: 35mm/s

# Building

Just straight forward. Put the ESP32 board inside the main case and close it with the cover. I use any small screws you have with careful to not break the internal supports.
